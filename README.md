# ACMS
Overview

An Archival Collections Management System (ACMS) is a software that provides integrated support for the archival workflow, including accessioning, description, arrangement, maintaining records, collection management, preservation and digitization.
ACMS used by archives staff to organize, control, and manage their collections. The system supports archivists in their routine work to identify records of enduring value, to preserve them and to make them accessible to other departments within the organization, as well as to donors, researchers and the public.
Patrons expect to find information from archival collections easily. To help them, archivists need a system that lets users retrieve information quickly and precisely. The aim of this system is;
•	to enable a register/inventory of the collection
•	to support the management of the digitization workflow and to develop methods and routines for digital archival records
•	to develop technical platform and standards for data interchange and mass storage of digital information
•	to create a search interface for the collection catalog
•	to manage research request intake and fulfillment
•	to offer a great, customized user experience
•	able to access anywhere, anytime, the ACMS should be web-based and support all mobile devices, via all browsers

Main functions of this system include;
•	Groups and user permissions to provide different levels of access for the administrative/backend users vs the general public
•	Aggregation and standardization or refinement of collection inventories
•	Dashboard reporting that tracks user requests, project progress, including number and types of items, percentage of project completed etc
